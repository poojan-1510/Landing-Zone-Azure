# Enterprise Azure Cloud Platform

## Overview
This project builds an **enterprise-ready cloud platform** on Azure using **Terraform** and **Azure DevOps**.  
It provides a secure, automated, and scalable foundation for deploying workloads across multiple environments (Dev, QA, Prod) with multi-region Kubernetes (AKS) clusters, CI/CD pipelines, observability, and governance.

---

## Features
- **Landing Zone**: Centralized, secure, and compliant Azure foundation  
- **Multi-Region AKS Clusters**: High-availability containerized workloads  
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automated infrastructure and application deployment using Azure DevOps  
- **Observability & Monitoring**: Centralized logging, metrics, dashboards, and alerts  
- **Security & Governance**: Azure Policies, RBAC, Key Vault integration, and Defender for Cloud  
- **Multi-Region Resilience**: Global load balancing, failover, and disaster recovery

## Prerequisites
- Terraform >= 1.5  
- Azure CLI  
- Azure Subscription with Owner/Contributor permissions  
- Azure DevOps Project & Organization  
- Git and optionally Helm for AKS app deployments

---

## Deployment
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/enterprise-azure-platform.git
cd enterprise-azure-platform
Initialize Terraform backend:
terraform init -backend-config="backend.tf"
Plan and apply for an environment:
terraform plan -var-file="environments/dev/dev.tfvars"
terraform apply -var-file="environments/dev/dev.tfvars"
Application CI/CD and monitoring are handled automatically via Azure DevOps pipelines.
Best Practices
Use Terraform modules for reusable resources
Store sensitive information in Azure Key Vault
Enforce Azure Policies for compliance
Keep all changes version-controlled in Git
Avoid manual portal changes; deploy via CI/CD pipelines

This is **one unified `README.md`** that covers the project, structure, prerequisites, deployment instructions, best practices, and references — all in a single document.  

If you want, I can now **start Phase 1** and generate the **Landing Zone Terraform skeleton** for Dev environment so we can begin implementation.  

Do you want me to do that next?

you are still. giving me fragments , give me properly in one , with every phase descriptions , references , version requirements and at end author

Ah! Got it — you want one cohesive, complete README.md that includes all phases, version requirements, references, and author — no fragments, fully structured. Here's a polished version you can directly use:
# Enterprise Azure Cloud Platform

## Overview
This project builds an **enterprise-ready cloud platform** on Azure using **Terraform** and **Azure DevOps**.  
It provides a secure, automated, and scalable foundation for deploying workloads across multiple environments (Dev, QA, Prod) with **multi-region AKS clusters**, CI/CD pipelines, observability, and governance.  

The platform is designed for enterprise use, allowing teams to deploy resources safely, consistently, and with zero manual intervention.

---

## Features
- **Landing Zone**: Centralized, secure, and compliant Azure foundation  
- **Multi-Region AKS Clusters**: High-availability containerized workloads  
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automated infrastructure and application deployment using Azure DevOps  
- **Observability & Monitoring**: Centralized logging, metrics, dashboards, and alerts  
- **Security & Governance**: Azure Policies, RBAC, Key Vault integration, Defender for Cloud  
- **Multi-Region Resilience**: Global load balancing, failover, and disaster recovery  

---

## Project Phases

### Phase 1 — Landing Zone
- Setup Management Groups and Subscriptions  
- Create Resource Groups for Dev, QA, Prod  
- Deploy Hub-Spoke Virtual Network with subnets  
- Configure NSGs, route tables, and peering  
- Implement RBAC, Azure Policies, and Tag Enforcement  
- Centralized logging and Key Vault for secrets  

### Phase 2 — Multi-Region AKS
- Deploy AKS clusters in multiple regions  
- Configure private networking, ingress controllers, and node pools  
- Integrate AKS with Azure AD for authentication  
- Connect AKS to Azure Container Registry (ACR)  
- Setup global traffic routing using Azure Front Door or Traffic Manager  

### Phase 3 — CI/CD Pipelines
- Infrastructure pipeline: Terraform plan & apply  
- Application CI pipeline: Build Docker images & push to ACR  
- Application CD pipeline: Deploy apps to AKS via Helm  
- Approval gates for Prod deployments  

### Phase 4 — Observability & Monitoring
- Azure Monitor & Log Analytics for infrastructure and AKS clusters  
- Application Insights for application-level telemetry  
- Alerts and dashboards for CPU, memory, network, and app performance  

### Phase 5 — Security & Governance
- Enforce Azure Policies and compliance standards  
- Defender for Cloud integration for threat detection  
- Role-based access control (RBAC) for Dev, QA, and Prod teams  
- Key Vault integration for secrets and sensitive configurations  

### Phase 6 — Multi-Region Resilience
- Azure Front Door for global load balancing  
- Geo-replication for storage and database resources  
- Failover and disaster recovery planning for business continuity
