# Enterprise Azure Cloud Platform

## Overview
This project builds an **enterprise-ready cloud platform** on Azure using **Terraform** and **Azure DevOps**.  
It provides a secure, automated, and scalable foundation for deploying workloads across multiple environments (Dev, QA, Prod) with **multi-region AKS clusters**, CI/CD pipelines, observability, and governance.  

The platform is designed for enterprise use, allowing teams to deploy resources safely, consistently, and with zero manual intervention.

---

## Features
- **Landing Zone**: Centralized, secure, and compliant Azure foundation.  
- **Multi-Region AKS Clusters**: High-availability containerized workloads.  
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automated infrastructure and application deployment using Azure DevOps.  
- **Observability & Monitoring**: Centralized logging, metrics, dashboards, and alerts.  
- **Security & Governance**: Azure Policies, RBAC, Key Vault integration, Defender for Cloud.  
- **Multi-Region Resilience**: Global load balancing, failover, and disaster recovery.

## Project Phases

### Phase 1 — Landing Zone
- Setup Management Groups and Subscriptions.  
- Create Resource Groups for Dev, QA, Prod.  
- Deploy Hub-Spoke Virtual Network with subnets.  
- Configure NSGs, route tables, and peering.  
- Implement RBAC, Azure Policies, and Tag Enforcement.  
- Centralized logging and Key Vault for secrets.  

### Phase 2 — Multi-Region AKS
- Deploy AKS clusters in multiple regions.  
- Configure private networking, ingress controllers, and node pools.  
- Integrate AKS with Azure AD for authentication.  
- Connect AKS to Azure Container Registry (ACR).  
- Setup global traffic routing using Azure Front Door or Traffic Manager.  

### Phase 3 — CI/CD Pipelines
- Infrastructure pipeline: Terraform plan & apply.  
- Application CI pipeline: Build Docker images & push to ACR.  
- Application CD pipeline: Deploy apps to AKS via Helm.  
- Approval gates for Prod deployments.  

### Phase 4 — Observability & Monitoring
- Azure Monitor & Log Analytics for infrastructure and AKS clusters.  
- Application Insights for application-level telemetry.  
- Alerts and dashboards for CPU, memory, network, and app performance.  

### Phase 5 — Security & Governance
- Enforce Azure Policies and compliance standards.  
- Defender for Cloud integration for threat detection.  
- Role-based access control (RBAC) for Dev, QA, and Prod teams.  
- Key Vault integration for secrets and sensitive configurations.  

### Phase 6 — Multi-Region Resilience
- Azure Front Door for global load balancing.  
- Geo-replication for storage and database resources.  
- Failover and disaster recovery planning for business continuity.
